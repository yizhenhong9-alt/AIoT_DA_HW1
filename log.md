# **Homework 1: Simple Linear Regression with CRISP-DM**

## **1. Business Understanding**

The primary objective of this assignment is to develop a simple linear regression model. This model will help in understanding the linear relationship between an independent variable `x` and a dependent variable `y`, modeled by the equation `y = ax + b`. The project aims to provide an interactive tool where users can adjust the parameters of the data generation process, such as the slope `a`, the y-intercept `b`, the amount of noise, and the number of data points. This will allow for a deeper understanding of how these parameters affect the regression model. The project will follow the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology.

## **2. Data Understanding**

The data for this project will be synthetically generated. This approach allows for a controlled environment to study the behavior of the linear regression model. The user will have the ability to specify the following parameters for data generation:
*   **Slope (a):** The coefficient of the independent variable `x`.
*   **Y-intercept (b):** The constant term in the linear equation.
*   **Noise:** Random noise will be added to the data to simulate real-world scenarios where the relationship between variables is not perfectly linear.
*   **Number of points:** The total number of data points to be generated.

## **3. Data Preparation**

Once the data is generated based on the user's specifications, it will be prepared for the modeling phase. This will involve:
*   **Creating a DataFrame:** The generated `x` and `y` values will be stored in a structured format, such as a pandas DataFrame.
*   **Splitting the data:** The dataset will be divided into a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the linear regression model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance on unseen data. A common split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

## **4. Modeling**

In this phase, a simple linear regression model will be built and trained.
*   **Model Selection:** A simple linear regression model is appropriate for this problem as we are trying to model the linear relationship between two variables.
*   **Implementation:** The model will be implemented in Python, utilizing the `scikit-learn` library, which provides a robust and easy-to-use implementation of linear regression.
*   **Training:** The model will be trained on the training dataset to learn the optimal values for the slope and y-intercept that best fit the data.

## **5. Evaluation**

The performance of the trained model will be evaluated using the testing set. The following metrics will be used:
*   **R-squared (R²):** This metric provides a measure of how well the model's predictions approximate the real data points. An R² value of 1 indicates a perfect fit.
*   **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** This metric measures the average of the squares of the errors, i.e., the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.
*   **Visualization:** The results will be visualized by plotting the original data points, the regression line, and the true underlying relationship. This will provide a clear visual comparison of the model's performance.

## **6. Deployment**

To make the model accessible and interactive, it will be deployed as a web application.
*   **Framework:** The web application will be developed using either Streamlit or Flask. These frameworks are well-suited for creating data-driven web applications in Python.
*   **User Interface:** The user interface will allow users to input the parameters for data generation (`a`, `b`, noise, number of points) and view the results of the model, including the evaluation metrics and visualizations. This interactive deployment will fulfill the project's goal of providing a hands-on tool for learning about simple linear regression.
